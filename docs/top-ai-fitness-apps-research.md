- Strength Score (0-1000 scale)
- 70% strength gains in year 1
- $4,000 hardware + subscription
- Real-time coaching via 500 data points from cables + camera

---

## Key Trends & Patterns

### 1. **Hybrid Approaches Win**
- Best apps combine **AI algorithms + human expertise** (Freeletics, JuggernautAI)
- Pure AI (Dr. Muscle, FitnessAI) or Pure Human (Future) are extremes
- **Sweet spot:** AI for personalization, humans for methodology design

### 2. **Progressive Overload is Core**
- Every successful app automates progressive overload
- Methods vary: RIR-based (JuggernautAI), volume-based (Fitbod), formula-based (Dr. Muscle)
- **Users want:** "Tell me what weight/reps to do next"

### 3. **Data is King (But Not Required)**
- Fitbod (400M), Freeletics (56M), Planfit (70M) leverage massive datasets
- BUT: Formula-based heuristics work well (Alpha Progression, Dr. Muscle)
- **Implication:** VoltLift can succeed with offline heuristics, layer in ML later

### 4. **Pricing Tiers**
- **Free:** Planfit (beginner focus)
- **$10-15/mo:** Fitbod, FitnessAI (mass market)
- **$35/mo:** JuggernautAI (specialist)
- **$199/mo:** Future (human coaching)
- **$1,700-4,000:** Tempo, Tonal (hardware)

### 5. **Recovery & Fatigue Management**
- Most apps track: Sleep, HRV, muscle soreness, workout intensity
- AI adjusts volume/intensity when under-recovered
- **Research-backed:** Sleep deprivation = 7-11% strength reduction

### 6. **Form Tracking = Hardware or ML**
- **Hardware approach:** Tempo (3D sensors), Tonal (cables + camera)
- **Software approach:** KinesteX (computer vision), Gymscore (video analysis)
- **Barrier:** Requires significant ML expertise OR expensive hardware
- **VoltLift strategy:** Partner with existing services, don't build in-house

### 7. **Privacy Concerns Growing**
- MyFitnessPal hack (150M users) raised awareness
- Users skeptical of AI monitoring
- Apps with "local-first" positioning have advantage
- **VoltLift opportunity:** Privacy-first as differentiator

---

## What Users Actually Want (Based on Reviews)

### ✅ **Must-Haves:**
1. **Progressive overload automation** - "Tell me what to lift"
2. **Visible progress** - Charts, PRs, strength scores
3. **Personalization** - Plans adapt to individual response
4. **Minimal manual entry** - Auto-suggestions, pre-fills
5. **Offline functionality** - Gym often has poor signal

### 🎯 **Nice-to-Haves:**
1. **Recovery guidance** - Sleep-based adjustments
2. **PR celebrations** - Gamification, motivation
3. **Weekly summaries** - AI insights on progress
4. **Exercise substitutions** - Equipment flexibility

### ❌ **Don't Cares (Surprisingly):**
1. **Video form analysis** - Nice but not critical for most users
2. **Social features** - Helpful for some, ignored by many
3. **Nutrition tracking** - Prefer dedicated apps (MyFitnessPal)
4. **Wearable integration** - Apple Watch nice, not required
