Programs define `supportedFrequencies: [3, 4, 6]`\n2. Each frequency has sessions in `frequencyVariants[freq].sessions`\n3. User selects frequency during enrollment (if multiple options)\n4. Program adapts session schedule to chosen frequency\n5. Frequency stored in settings for continuity\n\n**Next Steps** (not in this commit):\n- Add frequency variant data to GZCLP (3-day & 4-day)\n- Add nSuns variants (4/5/6-day)\n- Add Reddit PPL 5-day variant\n\n**Testing**:\n- UI renders frequency selector when program has multiple options\n- Selection is required before enrollment\n- Enrollment uses correct session schedule for selected frequency\n\nFiles modified:\n- types.ts (Program interface, UserSettings)\n- store/useStore.ts (activateProgram, migration v3)\n- pages/ProgramDetail.tsx (frequency selection UI)\n- constants.ts (3 new programs)\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
